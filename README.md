# Hello World ★

I build projects of all sizes, from small prototypes to full applications, and I enjoy using GitHub to track my progress and organize my work. With a focus on data, cloud, AI, and software, I aim to enhance my skills and gain hands-on experience by building tools that serve a clear purpose.
