# Hello and welcome to my profile! 👋🏽

My name is Mohamed, and I'm a computer science student at Georgia State University. I've always been passionate about coding, and I'm happy that I can showcase my projects using GitHub. For my career, I aspire to work within software engineering roles that focus on cloud architecture, full-stack development, or database management.

As I've grown as a developer, I realized how passionate I am about building solutions to real-world problems and helping people achieve their goals. For me, coding is more than a hobby, and I don't plan on slowing down anytime soon. I’m always excited to keep learning and building, so feel free to check out my repositories anytime! 🙂
