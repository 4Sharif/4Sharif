# Hello World ★

I enjoy building projects of all sizes, from small prototypes to full applications. My interests lie in data, cloud, AI, and software. I'm glad to use GitHub for tracking my progress and organizing my work. I’m always looking to improve my skills and gain hands-on experience by building practical tools that serve a clear purpose.
